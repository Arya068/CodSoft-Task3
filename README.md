👋 Welcome to My Counter App!

This is a simple and fun **Counter App** I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It's one of my beginner projects where I practiced DOM manipulation and basic interactivity with buttons

✨ What It Does

- ➕ Increases the counter when you click "Increment"
- ➖ Decreases the counter when you click "Decrement"
- 🔄 Resets the counter to 0 with the "Reset" button
- 💡 Simple, clean, and easy-to-use interface

 🛠️ Built With

 HTML – to structure the page  
 CSS – to style it nicely
